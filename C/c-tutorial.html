                            C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis
                            Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming
                            language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language
                            include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style;
                            these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an
                            operating system or compiler development.
                            Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from
                            the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are
                            mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few
                            programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

                            History of C language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss a brief
                            history of the c language. C programming language was developed in 1972 by
                            Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph),
                            located in the U.S.A. Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the c language. It
                            was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL,
                            etc.
                            Initially, C language was developed to be used in UNIX operating system. It
                            inherits many features of previous languages such as B and BCPL. Let's see the
                            programming languages that were developed before C language.

                            As every language contains a set of characters used to construct words,
                            statements, etc., C language also has a set of characters which include alphabets,
                            digits, and special symbols. C language supports a total of 256 characters.
                            Every C program contains statements. These statements are constructed using
                            words and these words are constructed using characters from C character set. C
                            language character set contains the following set of characters

                            Since keywords are referred names for a compiler, they canâ€™t be used as variable
                            names because by doing so, we are trying to assign a new meaning to the
                            keyword which is not allowed. You cannot redefine keywords.C language supports 32 keywords
